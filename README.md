# ColorQuest

ColorQuest is a dynamic color picker application built using Svelte and HTML5 Canvas. It allows users to select colors by pointing the mouse at specific pixels in the color selection area and to adjust colors by changing the hex code. The application updates the preview in real-time as the hex code changes or the user interacts with the canvas.

## Features

- **Interactive Color Picker**: Select colors by hovering over the canvas with your mouse.
- **Hex Code Input**: Change the color of the preview div by editing the hex code.
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically update the color across multiple formats (RGB, HSL, HSV, CMYK) when a color is selected.
- **Svelte-based**: Leverages the reactivity of Svelte for an optimized, performant color picking experience.
- **Canvas-based Rendering**: Uses the HTML5 canvas element to render the color picker, ensuring smooth interaction and rendering of the color gradients.
